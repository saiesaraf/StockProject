## Quick Start es5 
Include a reference to the zingchart library

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!--Script Reference [1] -->
  <script src="/zingchart/zingchart.min.js"></script>

</head>
<body>
  <!--Chart Component [2] -->
  <div id="myChart"></div>

  <script>
    let chartData = {
      type: 'pareto',
      series: [
        {
          values: [
            4642,
            4345,
            2350,
            1251
          ]
        }
      ]
    };

    // Render Method[3]
    zingchart.render({ 
      id: 'myChart',
      data: chartData,
      height: 400,
      width: '100%'
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Quick Start es6 Imports
A general best practice to use ZingChart in any of your frameworks is used in the following:

`import {zingchart, ZC} from 'zingchart/es6';`

And if you have and modules you want to include you do the following

`import {pareto} from 'zingchart/modules-es6/zingchart-pareto.min.js';`


## Quick Start es6 w/Script Modules

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Import Library [1] -->
  <script type="module">
    import {zingchart, ZC} from './zingchart/es6.js';
    import './zingchart/modules-es6/zingchart-pareto.min.js';
  </script>
  <!-- fallback for no module support -->
  <script nomodule src="/zingchart/zingchart.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Chart Component [2] -->
  <div id="myChart"></div>

  <script>
    let chartConfig = {
      type: 'pareto',
      series: [
        {
          values: [
            4642,
            4345,
            2350,
            1251
          ]
        }
      ]
    };

    // Render Method[3]
    zingchart.render({ 
      id: 'myChart',
      data: chartConfig,
      height: 400,
      width: '100%'
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```


## Browserify
This package supports the CommonJS module format to be used with bundlers such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) when being used with NPM.

Usage : `var zingchart = require('zingchart');`



## Package Directory
The package includes the following:
```
|   README.md
├── client
│   ├── zingchart.min.js
│   ├── modules
├── custom
│   ├── build.js
|   ...
```

<!--## Custom Build
***(requires Node.js)***

The zingchart.min.js file in the root directory is a fully functional build which includes the majority of functionality within the library. If you wanted to slim down the library and only provide functionality that you need, we have included a build tool that allows you to create a custom library build for the client side version. The /modules folder contains a complete collection of dependencies for the zingchart library.

For example, if you wanted to create a build that only contained functionality for line and pie charts, you would run the command

```
$ node build.js <configPath> <modules>
```
* `configPath` (optional) - The path to the .cnf file to provide module options
* `modules` (optional) -The module arguments to provide the build tool without using a .cnf file.

Both examples will provide the same functionality for the line/pie example.


#### Example 1
```
$ node build.js zingchart.cnf
```
Inside `zingchart.cnf`:
```js
{"modules":["line","pie"]}
```

#### Example 2
```
$ node build.js line pie
```
-->
